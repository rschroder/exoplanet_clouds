# Cloud formation of condensiblespecies in exoplanet atmospheresusing the Clausius-Clapeyron equation
Clouds can have a major impact on a planet's energy balance. They can increase a planet's albedo, reflecting the parent star's radiation. They can also be strongly absorbing \cite{Seager2010}. As such, they impact the transport of radiation, the chemistry of the atmosphere, and the planet's surface temperature \cite{Marley2010}. In this paper, we will investigate whether particular molecular species observed in an exoplanet's spectra can condense to form clouds. Using the Clausius-Clapeyron framework outlined in Sanchez-Lavega et al.\cite{Sanchez-Lavega2003}, we will use equations  7,12,16,20, and data from tables I, II, and III to validate our implementation of their framework using solar system planet atmospheres and their reference exoplanet, HD209458b. Our implementation attempts to determine the possibility of cloud formation in any exoplanet's atmosphere. If clouds are present, we attempt to determine the location of the cloud base and the cloud's vertical extent.
